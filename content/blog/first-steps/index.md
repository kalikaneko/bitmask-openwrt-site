# What about...

Some time ago, I was talking to a good friend that was asking for advice about
how their parents could secure internet communications. "Use a VPN", is one of
the mantras I repeat without thinking too much.

But yeah, some times asking some people to install apps in their devices is not
feasible. Hmm - there are these cheap pocket routers around, that you can use
with power banks. That'd be interesting: you configure it once, and then you
just let people connect to the hotspot. Or you can just plug a cheap VoIP box
to the LAN port, or whatever.

There's something quite appealing about the physicality of a hardware button, and
the feedback that a simple led provides.

# Hello embedded world 

Some time later (a *lot* of things happened in the meantime), I'm happy to announce
the first iteration of that idea. It's still unpolished, but hey, it works.

It's a very interesting challenge to fit things into constrained resources. As
an user, the openwrt project had my admiration. Now that I've begun to use
their tools, they have all my respect.
